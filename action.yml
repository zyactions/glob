branding:
  icon: filter
  color: black

inputs:
  pattern:
    description: >
      One or more file, path, or placeholder patterns that describe which items to match.

      Supports multiline strings.
    type: string
    required: true
    default: ''
  values:
    description: >
      An optional list of values to be matched (separated by line breaks).

      The action operates on the life file system if neither the `values`-, nor the `pipe`-input
      is set.

      This input must be used mutually exclusive with the `pipe` input.
    type: string
    required: false
    default: ''
  pipe:
    description: >
      An optional pipe input from which the input values are to be read.

      This must be set to a valid shell command line (bash) that can be used for piping. The
      command must output to `stdout` and separate the individual values by line breaks.

      WARNING:
      The command passed to this input will be evaluated and should not come from untrusted
      sources.

  return-pipe:
    description: >
      Enable this option to return a shell (bash) command in the `pipe` output that can be
      used for piping.

      The output command must be `eval`ed to return the results. It can also be passed to 
      other actions that support a `pipe` input.

      The `matches` output will not be populated if this option is enabled.
    type: boolean
    required: false
    default: false

outputs:
  matches:
    description: >
      A list of all matching elements, delimited by newlines or spaces (if the `quote` option is
      used).

      This output is only available if the `return-pipe` option is not enabled.

  pipe:

      A shell (bash) command which can be used for piping.
      
      This output is only available if the `return-pipe` option is enabled.
